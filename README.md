# STEG Virtual Course on Key Concepts in Macro Development

This is repo contains the lecture notes and materials of the [STEG Course on Macro Development](https://steg.cepr.org/events/stegvirtualcourse2021).

I also have replicated in R the materials prepared by [Julieta Caunedo](https://www.julietacaunedo.com/) for Lecture 2. Her repo can be access [here](https://github.com/julicaunedo/STEG_Lecture2).

This is just a compilation for personal use.
